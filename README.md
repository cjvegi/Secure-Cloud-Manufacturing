# [Integration of mechanical reconfiguration for RFID-enabled manipulation in a cloud manufacturing testbed](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/3Tnvlyll1QzvYm)

## Objective
Developing methods and techniques to make large-scale manufacturing systems safer, more secure, and more productive, enabling them to produce high-quality products for consumers at modest cost.

## My contribution: 
### Implementing interchangeable grippers for the robot

In the video below, Robot showcases change of grippers depending on part type
