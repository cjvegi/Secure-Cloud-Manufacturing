# Secure Cloud Manufacturing

## Objective
Developing methods and techniques to make large-scale manufacturing systems safer, more secure, and more productive, enabling them to produce high-quality products for consumers at modest cost.

## My contribution: 
1. Implementing interchangeable grippers for the robot

                           #### Robot showcasing change of grippers depending on part type

2. Developed robot programs to meet the needs of designed manufacturing process

                            #### robot program being triggered by part RFID tag and manufacturing operations that follow as a result of an integration of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), CNC and Robot.
